# Speech-Recognition-Project
Calcy- The Speaking Calculator is a speech based calculator developed in C++ using the Hidden Markov Model. The input sentence is trimmed appropriately to separate the operands and operator and is fed to the trained HMM model to produce the most accurate result. The result is spoken out by the Calculator.
